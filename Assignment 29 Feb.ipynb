    "Ans:\n",
    "79 characters\n",
    "\n",
    "13. What are the benifits of using python?\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "OPEN SOURCE\n",
    "Not every technology is free in the world. Some of them demand a considerable amount of payment to use regularly. The programming language is open source and available to use for free of cost. Therefore, it attracts a lot of beginners to start working from the early stages of programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "VIBRANT COMMUNITY\n",
    "A vast community of programmers are found using Python for a long time. A perfect set of programmers under one roof not only clarifies doubts but also engages in providing best practices. The community has a long list of users who can help freshers in finding their objectives quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The language is easy to use and understand while developing different kinds of applications. Therefore, a small tip from experienced folks can give a massive relief if you are stuck in the middle of the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "WORK WITH LESS CODE\n",
    "The hybrid programming language does not demand you to put a long list of code to make it work. This plays a vital role in avoiding maximum confusion because of obvious reasons. No wonder Python has an excellent reputation in terms of easy to use features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python may not be an excellent catch for programmers if they are looking forward to a quick catch. It is known to work slower than a few of the languages. This can be considered as a drawback but balances its quality in other features.\n",
    "\n",
    "EASY INTEGRATIONS\n",
    "It is a known fact that not every application works with a single programming language code. Some of the features require an external code to make the functionality work. Hence, choosing a universal programming language helps you integrate easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is one of the best applications in the market for integration purposes because of powerful control capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Easy integration is one of the top benefits of using Python because of absolute requirements. Python can easily connect with C, C++, Java, and so on. It also processes markup languages like XML because it helps modern applications to work efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "PRODUCTIVITY\n",
    "If you are a fresher and looking forward to joining a company, you should have enough exposure to save time without compromising the quality. Python is one of the best programming languages because it is accessible to code.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the work becomes more accessible and compact, it is evident that the productivity rate goes higher. Python gives a complete room to increase productivity because of integrity and convenience. The robust control capabilities provide a way to increase the pace of applications quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING\n",
    "Data structures are a vital element to consider because it reduces repetitive work overtime. The majority of programming languages define objects with multiple elements to make the job easier. Python is equipped specially to work in an object-oriented programming environment because of high-level programming language. It offers support features like Pearl, Java, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "SAFETY AND SECURITY\n",
    "Unlike C based programming languages, Python does not come with specific pointers. With no pointers, the programming language is more reliable compared to alternative programming languages. As the programming languages have no pointers, it is evident that programmers would effectively observe the program crash errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "EASY SYNTAX\n",
    "The syntax architecture gives you information about learning convenience. Many young programmers are switching to Python compared to other programming languages because it is easy to learn and implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The easy syntax element of the programming language enables users to learn the art quickly. As the programming is performed, it is evident that people tend to attract in rapid time.\n",
    "\n",
    "HIGH-LEVEL LANGUAGE AND EASY READABILITY\n",
    "Python is considered as a high-level programming language because of its functionalities. The language can be used to design both straightforward and complex websites. Application development is on the rise of this generation because of consumer demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "The coding format is designed efficiently, which allows programmers to read and edit easily. It is highly considered as a Pseudo-code because of simplicity. Many programmers from the current generation prefer using prototypes to explain the situation to other programmers in an easy way.\n",
    "\n",
    "CONCLUSION\n",
    "Programming languages are plenty, but finding the best one helps you in the long run. Python is one of the best languages used to develop various applications because of advanced features. It is necessary to know the benefits of using Python while planning because it helps prepare a proper roadmap for the project.\n",

    "14. How is memory mannaged in python ?\n",
    "Memory management in Python involves a private heap containing all Python objects and data structures. The management of this private heap is ensured internally by the Python memory manager.\n",

    "15. How to install python and set a path variable?\n",
    "Ans: Download the python installer from official website(https://www.python.org/downloads) \n",
    "    \n",
    "    2.Run the installer and follow the prompts and type 'python'to your PATH.make sure to select \"Yes\".\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3.Once installation is complete,open the command prompt and type 'python' to confirm that python is installed and the PATH variable is set correctly.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    4.set PATH variable permanently,you need to add the python installation directory to the PATH enviornment variable.\n",
    "    Here how you can do it:\n",
    "                            a)Open the start menu and search for \"Enviormnet Variables\".\n",
    "                            b)Click on \"Edit the system environment variables\".\n",
    "                            c)In system properties window,click on the\"Enviornment Variables \"button.\n",
    "                            d)Under\"System Variables\",scroll down and find the \"Path\"variable,then click on \"Edit\".\n",
    "                            e)Click on \"New\" and add the path to the python installation directory(e.g.C:\\Python3x)\n",
    "                            f)Cloase all windows and restart the command prompt.\n",
    "                    \n",
    "                    after following step you should able to run python from any location in the command prompt.\n",
